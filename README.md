# Lisp
Why? because ... lisp

Upon reading literature in regards to purely functional languages. I've come across a short article in which the functional paradigm of thought bifurcates into two distinct philosophical domains. One being the ol' Unix's modular programming precept, and the other being stone-cold monolithic design.
According to the author, Lisp is monolithic, while Haskell is modular. "One difference in philosophy of Lisp (e.g. Common Lisp, Emacs Lisp) and Haskell is that the latter makes liberal use of many tiny functions that do one single task. This is known as composability, or the UNIX philosophy. In Lisp a procedure tends to accept many options which configure its behaviour. This is known as monolithism, or to make procedures like a kitchen-sink, or a Swiss-army knife." [https://chrisdone.com/posts/haskell-lisp-philosophy-difference]
Goodbye Lisp, at least for now. Hello, Haskell and Stack (so we script on Linux and use return exit codes. ( an easy way to communicate with the OS ))
